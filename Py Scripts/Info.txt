These scripts generate interactive HTML plot files containing two age groups for comparison, with a custom legend. 
The code has been refactored for improved functionality.

A plot_name variable is defined to name both the HTML file and the output directory where the results are saved. 
The script also copies itself into the output directory, ensuring that all used parameters are documented.

To use the scripts in Visual Studio Code, the necessary modules must first be imported into the Python console.
