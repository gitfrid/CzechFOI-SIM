### CzechFOI-DA

**Czech FOI Data Analysis** is a solution for analyzing, calculating, and visualizing FOI (Freedom of Information) data efficiently. <br>It's faster and more flexible than using spreadsheets but requires some IT knowledge.

The [Python Scripts](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/tree/main/Py%20Scripts) process and visualize CSV data from the [TERRA folder](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/tree/main/TERRA), generating interactive HTML plots. <br>Each plot compares two age groups. To interact with the plots, click on a legend entry to show/hide curves.

Download the processed plots for analysis from the [Plot Results Folder](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/tree/main/Plot%20Results). Or simply adapt and run the [Python scripts](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/blob/main/Py%20Scripts/AH%29%202D%206-Axis%20age-compare%20rolling-mean%20significance-1D-2D%20different-scale.py) to meet your own analysis requirements!

Dates are counted as the number of days since [January 1, 2020](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/blob/main/Plot%20Results/Days%20to%20Date%20Translation%20Day%20Date%20Translation/Days%20to%20Date%20Translation%20Day%20Date%20Translation.png), for easier processing. "AGE_2023" represents age on January 1, 2023. <br>The data can optionally be normalized per 100,000 for comparison.

Access the original Czech FOI data from a [Freedom of Information request](https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/uzis-data-analysis/blob/main/data/Vesely_106_202403141131.tar.xz). To learn how the Pivot CSV files in the TERRA folder were created, see the [wiki](https://github.com/gitfrid/CzechFOI-DA/wiki)

<br>**Abbreviations:** The figures are per age group from the CSV files in the TERRA folder:
| **Deaths**        | **Definition**                                                       | **Population/Doses**  | **Definition**                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| NUM_D             | Number deaths                                                        | NUM_POP               | Total people                                          |
| NUM_DUVX          | Number unvaxed deaths                                                | NUM_UVX               | Number of unvaxed people                              |
| NUM_DVX           | Number vaxed deaths                                                  | NUM_VX                | Number of vaxed people                                |
| NUM_DVD1-DVD7     | Number deaths doses 1 - 7                                            | NUM_VD1-VD7           | Number of vax doses 1 - 7                             |
| NUM_DVDA          | Number deaths from all doses                                         | NUM_VDA               | Total number of all vax doses (sum)                   |

**The first derivative represents speed** because it measures how fast something changes over time.
**The second derivative represents acceleration** as it measures how fast the speed (or first derivative) changes over time, showing how quickly the speed is increasing or decreasing.

The py script ending with **same-scale** uses the same y-axis scale for both age groups. Use this version to compare similar age groups. The file ending with **different-scale** uses different y-axes with different scales for each age group.
